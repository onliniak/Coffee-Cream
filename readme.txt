== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Supported browsers =

TL;DR all CSS3 browsers.

Firefox 6+, Opera "Classic" 11.64-12.18 (ugly fonts), Chrome 30+/Vivaldi/"New" Opera, IE 9+, WebKit( Midori 0.5, Luakit 1.8.0, Arora 0.11, Safari 9.1.3+ etc.), tested on latest Firefox (Linux).

= Tested screen resolutions =

1366x768 (mainly, laptop), 1920x1080, 1440x900, 600x831 (Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0, mainly), Motorola Moto G (falcon).

= Problems =

- Sticky post display only "Sticky" note.
- Author info without special style, low priority. You can use .ocean_cream_info CSS class. 
- I don't recommend screen readers and text-browsers like lynks. It's non-accessibility theme.
- Max 4 columns in "classic" editor.
- No support for custom post formats. 
- Single/Inline quotes broken in mobile, when links are too long. 

= Compatibility with CSS 2.1/HTML4 browsers =

It works (reading posts, correct colors) … but

Images size, headers size, sticky button, mobile menu/sidebar button, comments don't work.

= Help, my plugins don't works (load in footer) =

Some plugins use get_footer to load scripts in footer.
But in this case we don't use footer.php, so you must change get_footer to wp_footer .

= I want to change XYZ =

For colors, look at https://github.com/onliniak/ocean-cream/blob/github-flavoured/inc/customizer_output.php#L35 for all needed CSS selectors. Or try Customizer, by copy /inc directory and add this two lines <https://github.com/onliniak/ocean-cream/blob/github-flavoured/functions.php#L2>. Warning - insecure. 
For other changes use theme editor and favourite search engine (for example Google)
or write new support ticket.

= Why the_author_meta ? (author page) =

In the future it will be easier to change presented informations.

= I want to display Facebook/Skype/xyz in author's page. =

Example: <https://easywebdesigntutorials.com/create-your-own-author-bio-box-in-wordpress-without-a-plugin/> <http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-examples#Skype>

Add this code to your functions.php

function ocean_cream_author_box( $user_contact ) {
// add new field to profile.php
// sanitize remove invalid charackters on input, escape in output.
 $user_contact['facebook'] = sanitize_text_field(__( 'Facebook name, example: https://www.facebook.com/name' ));
 $user_contact['skype'] = sanitize_text_field(__( 'Skype username' ));
 return $user_contact;
}
add_filter( 'user_contactmethods', 'ocean_cream_author_box' );

and this code to author.php

		<dt> <?php esc_html_e('Facebook', 'ocean-cream'); ?>   </dt>
<dd> <a class="url" href="https://www.facebook.com/<?php esc_html(the_author_meta('facebook')) ?>" rel="me">My Facebook</a> </dd>
	 ----------------
		<dt> <?php esc_html_e('Skype', 'ocean-cream'); ?>   </dt>
<dd> <a class="url" href="skype:<?php esc_html(the_author_meta('skype')) ?>?chat" rel="me">Chat with me on Skype</a> </dd>	 

= How exactly works "automatic screen" ? =

The size of the font and entry / sidebar is automatically determined based on the width of the window.

 = I have under 100 points in Google Page Insight =

 You must add Expire Headers and Gzip support to your .htaccess . Also plugins may decrease score.

 = Wrong gramatic =

 Create new ticket or even better send new pull request on Github.
