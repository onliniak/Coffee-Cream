== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help, my plugins don't works (load in footer) =

Some plugins use get_footer to load scripts in footer.
But in this case we don't use footer.php, so you must change get_footer to wp_footer .

= I want to change XYZ =

For colors use WP Customizer (/wp-admin/customize.php).
For other changes use theme editor and favourite search engine (for example Google)
or write new support ticket.

= In  Customizer, some colors is invisible =

I not use sidebar text and pagination background, it doesn't make sense.

= How reset all colors options ? =

Just delete theme_mods_ocean-cream from wp_options table.

= Why the_author_meta ? (author page) =

In the future it will be easier to change presented informations. 

= How exactly works "automatic screen" ? =

The size of the font and entry / sidebar is automatically determined based on the width of the window.

 = I have under 100 points in Google Page Insight =
 
 You must add Expire Headers and Gzip support to your .htaccess . Also plugins may decrease score.

 This is for compatibility issues. It will be remove in future releases.
 
 = Wrong gramatic =
 
 Create new ticket or even better send new pull request on Github.
