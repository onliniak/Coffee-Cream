# Ocean Cream
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/onliniak/ocean-cream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/onliniak/ocean-cream)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ocean-cream/badge/?version=master)](https://ocean-cream.readthedocs.io/pl/master/?badge=master)

![Standard](screenshot.png "Standard")

Quick overwiew:

- Lightweight WordPress blog theme (about 30 kB with WordPress Gutenberg CSS and emojis)
- Non-white and minimalistic
- Responsive web design
- [PDF](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/ocean-cream/master/ocean-cream.pdf) (included by default in WordPress repo), [EPUB](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ocean-cream/downloads/epub/master/) and [HTML](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ocean-cream/downloads/htmlzip/master/) documentation based on Sphinx (with manual translation).
  - I am little confused … I am not able to create "elegant" english documentation, from the other hand if I create documentation in polish no one understand that. 
- Faster website (compared to Twenty Nineteen)
- jQuery only on demand
- Hidden sidebar and comments
- Critical css for higher Google PageSpeed Insight
    - My goal is for the theme to be at least 90% compatible with Google PageSpeed Insight after adding the cache (Expire Headers and Gzip) in htaccess.
 - 2 main branches:
    - Master = stable = official version for WordPress repository and documentation.
    - github-flavoured = testing = child theme with unverified or not approved features like WP Customizer, CDN, copyright protection, beige AMP style or numeric keyboard navigation.
