Coffee Cream remix (stable)

This is Coffee Cream without custom code aka stable. 90% WordPress functions. 

## Features :

- Without jQuery
- True all in one
- Under 10kb size
- Numeric keyboard navigation. Use 4 for previous post and 6 for next. 

## Know Issues :

### Help, my sidebar is broken !

Disable all "minify/compress" HTML options. In this case we have this code :

#sidiBer[style*='display: block'] ~ article {

Plugins change this to #sidiBer[style*='display:block'] ~ article { ,
When we delete space between display: and block â†’ browser skip this line.
In this line, we say "if sidebar is open (display: block), move article (a.k.a. post) 25% to right (or give me space for my sidebar)."
